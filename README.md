# Find a coach web app (Udemy practice app)
Practice repository from Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller's Udemy course on Vue.js.
As this was a frontend course, Firebase was used as the server-side (backend).
## How to run
Maximilian:
> If you want to run my attached code, you need to follow these steps:
> 1. Run `npm install` in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
> will create a `node_modules` folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment
> because that would bloat the ZIP file)
> 2. Run 'npm run serve' to bring up the development server, view the app at `localhost:8080`
> (or whichever port is shown in your terminal).
